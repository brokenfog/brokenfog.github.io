Love The Sewanee Fog. I have made a recording of your stream to alert you to poor quality. I made the recording on March 31st, 2022 at 12:04pm. 0-30 seconds is your stream and 31-40 seconds is the stream of another station. I posted the recording to https://brokenfog.github.io/ The volume of the second stream is loud because I have to turn the volume to full to hear your stream.
